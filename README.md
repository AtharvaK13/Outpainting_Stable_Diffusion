# Image Outpainting with Stable Diffusion

This project utilizes the Stable Diffusion model to perform image outpainting, allowing for the expansion of images beyond their original borders. This README covers the setup, usage, and contribution guidelines for this project.
The model used for outpainting in this project is Stability AI's stable-diffusion-2-inpainting.

## Project Overview

This project aims to expand images horizontally or vertically using the Stable Diffusion model to seamlessly outpaint the edges. It is particularly focused on urban landscapes and cityscapes, but can be adapted for other types of images.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Huggingface Diffusers
